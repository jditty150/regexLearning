		// need + because we always need to have 1 or more for emails 
		// everything before @ symbol is what could be in the username
		// everything after @ and before . symbol is what could be as the actual email source
		// everything after . symbol is normally the com part where we make sure it only has 2-4 characters cause only 3 letters
